# -Dq.io-Intermediate_Python_and_Pandas_Guided_Project_Star_Wars_Survey
My take on Dq's Guided project for the intermediate Python and Pandas course, analyzing Star Wars survey Data.

In this project, you'll be working with Jupyter notebook and analyzing data on the Star Wars movies. When you're finished, you'll have a notebook you can either add to your portfolio, or expand on your own.

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you download from their GitHub repository (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

Main goals:

    Working with Pandas datasets
    Performing exploratory analysis
    Formulating hypothesis and testing them through data analysis
    Visuializing data
